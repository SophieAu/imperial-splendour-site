### Hurry up admiral, the fleet is awaiting your command!

PIC to be entered here

Today 224 years ago the Battle of the Nile started. Is there a better day to release Imperial Splendour - Rise of the Republic v. 1.2?

So here it is, after 3 years of hard work, Rise of the Republic 1.2 - Northern Wars Update.

</center>

So what's in it? Of course the 3 Northern European factions: Sweden, Denmark and Russia. 

But not just that, the whole AI got a rework. Also, the armies of Spain and Austria partly await your command! 

We also wrote tons of descriptions. In total descriptions numbering around 50.000 words were added. The soundtrack is completely reworked too. The soundtrack is still a Classical music soundtrack and uses calmer music for the campaign (mostly Piano music), more vivid (for example2 march of Beethoven) and full orchestra music for the land battles and finally mostly string quartets/quintets for naval battles. Overall the soundtrack was expanded with much more pieces than before. You can find a full list of used tracks below. 

Last but not least: 

The navies got a huge rework. Every major naval faction now has specific new ships and designs for you to construct and rule the waves.

The following music is included:
