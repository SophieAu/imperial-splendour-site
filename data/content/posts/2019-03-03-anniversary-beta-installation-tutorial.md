<p>2. Extract all the files and the folder from the RotR 1.1.zip file wherever you want (Imperial.Splendour_Install.exe, IS_FileList.txt and the folder IS_Files) <b><u>excluding</u></b> the Empire Total War folder

<p>4. Double click on the Imperial.Splendour_Install.exe file (perhaps you need to give the file admin allowance or let windows access it. If a firewall window pops up, click on further information and allow the file to be executed. No worries these are just the windows defender settings for unknown files.)</p>

<p>(4.1) If you have not installed <a href="https://www.java.com/en/download/" rel="noopener">JAVA Runtime</a> the installer will ask you to install it.</p>

<p>5. Follow the steps in the installer, most notably point the installer towards your "Empire Total War" folder. (NOT the "data" folder)

<p>6. At the end of the process, the installer asks if you want creates an Imperial Splendour shortcut on your desktop and afterwards, if you want to launch RotR

<p>7. To activate RotR start the launcher (basic setting is vanilla ETW) and click on "Switch", then the RotR lettering will appear

<hr />

<p>If it's not working please give us access to the content of your <b>IS_Launcher.log</b> file. It's in the <em>[...]\Empire Total War</em> folder</p>

<p>If this leads to no solution, do the following (all files should be in the <em>\[...]\Empire Total War\IS_Files</em> folder. If not extract the .zip again, the files are there in the <em>IS_Files</em> folder):</p>

<p>1. Move all ".pack" files into the <em>\[...]\Empire Total War\data</em> folder.</p>

<p>2. Move all ".esf" ".lua" and ".tga" files into the <em>\[...]\Empire Total War\data\campaigns\imperial_splendour</em> folder. If the "imperial_splendour" folder doesn't exist, create one.</p>

<p>3. Move the "user.empire_script.txt" file to the following folder: <em>C:\document and setting\Users\"yourname"\AppData\Roaming\The Creative Assembly\Empire\script.</em> If you can't find the folder, it's in a hidden folder. You have to enable "show hidden folders" in your OS.</p>
