## Today we present you the latest work from June, featuring mostly colonial units in the West Indies.

As the West India Regiment was already in the June blog let's start with the British units!

The first units are the Black light infantry in 2 variants: Loyal Black Rangers, recruitable in the orginally British colonies and Black Chasseurs, recruitable in the other colonies. Both units have a bonus in fighting in the West Indies:
