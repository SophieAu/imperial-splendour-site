## Today we present you the latest work from June, featuring mostly colonial units in the West Indies.

As the West India Regiment was already in the June blog let's start with the British units!

The first units are the Black light infantry in 2 variants: Loyal Black Rangers, recruitable in the orginally British colonies and Black Chasseurs, recruitable in the other colonies. Both units have a bonus in fighting in the West Indies:

Also the British can recruit a cavalry unit in Hispaniola and Cuba, the Ulhans Britannique. Historically they were recruited for service in Hispaniola in Europe as an auxillary unit for the British campaign in Hispaniola. Due to the climate in the West Indies and the yellow fewer many men died. Therefore the unit have only 60 men.
