This is the townhall of Coburg. The model is actually different from the townhall as it is today because some alteritions were done in the early 20th century. As I’m using this model in the 18th century mod Imperial Splendour I tried to represent the state of the townhall in that era. The mayor differences are that the ground floor still looked like several buildings in the 18th century because this is, what the townhall was. Several buildings were merged together to create the townhall. When this was done the ground floor was left as it was.
The ground floor were only changed in the early 20th century and a balcony was added in the middle of the first floor.

The palace was situated near Wolfenbüttel in today lower saxony. In it a large art colledtion from the dukes of Brunswick was located which is today in the Herzog Anton Ulrich-Museum. The palace was build in Half-timbering construction on a wet meadow which let the palace literally rot. The maintenance costs were high so that the palace was dismantled in 1813 but parts of it can still be seen in the town of Salzdahlum.

This is a draft by Georg Ludwig Laves the most important Hanoverian architect in the 1st half of the 19th century. He planned to build a huge palace north of Hanover on what is now called the “Königsworther Platz”. This palace was supposed to represent the new status of the monarchs of Hanover who were made Kings of Hannover after the Napoleonic Wars.

This is a city model for London I made for the ETW mod Imperial Splendour. Most buildings are historical ones. Just some houses that show their backside towards the ETW direction of view are not.
You can see St Paul's, Handel House, Banqueting House, Buckingham House and many more.

The model was made for the ETW mod Imperial Splendour. It serves as a city model for the town of Hannover. In the model itself there are many historical buildings that were once located in Hannover (and are demolished today) as well as several drafts which were never built.
I tried to represent the division between the old town, coming from the middle ages on the right with timber-frame and Renaissance houses and the new town (“Calenberger Neustadt”) on the left which was built in the 17th century and where the townhouses of the nobility stood.
Most prominent on the right is the Marktkirche (Market Church). Outside the actual town you can see the Nikolaikapelle (Nikolai chapel) with its graveyard. Today the Nikolaikapelle is a ruin.

This is the Harling’sche Haus which was located in the Calenberger Str. 29/30 in Hannover. The central part of the building was built from 1679-1682 by the Oberstallmeister Christian Friedrich von Harling. The 2 wings were added by the Hofkramer Schmahle who bought the house from the heiress of von Harling in 1721. Finally it was demolished in 1874. 

The model represents the mid 18th century state after the 2 wings were added.

St Stephen's Chapel was a chapel in the old Palace of Westminster. It became the Chamber of the House of Commons.
