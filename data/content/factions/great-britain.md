Your economy is only based on your trade roads, from the colonies or other factions, Britain has to maintain a good relationship with others or has to build a solid colonial Imperialism in danger since the American Revolution. 

In the West, the United States are a danger for the American colonies and the Iroquois Confederation is not powerful enough to resist the new rising nation, you have to act quickly if you want to keep Canada. Inthe East, the war between Mughals and Marathas is almost over and the winner will probably ask for supremacy on the British East India Company territories.

The advantage of playing Britain is the possibility of a larger colonial roster compared to the other colonial factions due to a less restricted recruitment limit, supplied by marine troops (Line, Grenadier and Light Infantries) which can be recruited on the American coastal territories and local auxiliary units (Native American units, Black Slaves, Sepoys), however, their upkeep cost us pretty high so be careful to a good enough economy to support your colonial expeditions.

If one of your trade roads is blocked you will have the chance to review the economic issues from the original IS (in clear it will be difficult not to have a game over), so be careful to secure those and to have good diplomatic relations with the other factions...
