heroText: It is the year 1783. The **American** Revolution has shown the world
  that the order of a monarch can be disputed by his own subjects. Colonies can
  claim independence in the name of Liberty. Events like this could topple the
  absolute monarchies that ruled Europe for nearly a thousand years.

  - text: Fight in the Revolutionary Wars. Command your armies to destroy the old
      order or preserve it. Rewrite history. The world is at your feet. To give
      you an authentic feeling for the battles of this period we created armies
      with historically accurate uniforms.

  - text: But historical accuracy does not end with new fancy uniforms. There are many historical characters in the game that you already know or whose portrait you might have seen in a museum. More than 230 portraits have been added to the game to replace the vanilla portrait sets of ETW and give you an 18th century feeling.

  - text: Additionally, RotR gives a more authentic feeling on the campaign map. Several factions have a new UI and all have their historical flags. You might also recognize some of the cities and buildings as 3D recreations of their actual historical counterparts.
