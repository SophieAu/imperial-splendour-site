heroText: It is the year 1783. The American Revolution has shown the world that
  the order of a monarch can be disputed by his own subjects. Colonies can claim
  independence in the name of Liberty. Events like this could topple the
  absolute monarchies that ruled Europe for nearly a thousand years.

      order or preserve it. Rewrite history. The world is at your feet. To give
      you an authentic feeling for the battles of this period we created armies
      with historically accurate uniforms.
