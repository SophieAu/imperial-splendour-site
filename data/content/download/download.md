If you need help, check out the [installation tutorial](/blog/2022-08-01-rotr-12-installation-tutorial/).

**Uninstall / deactivate every previous install of RotR, Imperial Splendour (**if you use the launcher, uninstall through the launcher!**) or any other mod.**

**Please let the first turn of a campaign just pass without doing anything. That's important as the game grooves itself in!**

If you use any other Anti-Virus-Program than Windows Defender, the files can be flagged as Viruses. **THEY ARE NOT!** They are just new to the world and as most Anti-Virus-Programs work on a 'Better-save-than-sorry' philosophy the files are flagged as potential harmful even when they are not. **So if you use any other Anti-Virus-Program than Windows Defender you should choose the manual download.**
