  As a dane, I am so excited for the Northern Wars update. You guys are really
  going all out with the immersion,  implenting the native Danish words. If I
  may suggest, u should consider rename Danish army tech 5.7 (jægere), 6.3 (let
  infanteri bataljoner) and 6.4 (let kavaleri) so it is Danish grammar correct.
  In Denmark philosophy tech-tree, u could change it to following 2.8 (Det
  Kongelige Danske Skildre-, Billedhugger- og Bygnings-Akademi i København) and
  3.5 ( Det Kongelige Danske Videnskabernes Selskab). If you would like, I could
  maybe help you translate English to Danish. If you wish to take me up on my
  offer, here is my Discord: Mastermind#6631 and E-mail:
  jacobbirkemose@gmail.com. I am mostly on Discord, so you will have a higher
  chance on contacting me there. Keep up the good work guys!
