comment: "@Quintus Hortensius Hortalus \r\nWell than, Seem like you have a bright future after leaving Colonialism 1600 AD behind.\r\nAs for asking “Him” again. I think it not possible, Since “He\" avoids (or maybe “forgot\") to answer tech trees question.\r\nSince “He\" is working on about a late era Submod (Honestly, I think “He\" should try to debug the Early era first. Since it buggy as hell.)\r\nBut anyway I think IS will be prosper, Unlike Colonialism 1600 AD that in constantly decline. \r\nGood-luck Sir.\r\n-Anonymous"
